\title{Make a test operating model from a single FLStock object}
\usage{

\item{nseasons}{The number of seasons}

\item{recruitment_seasons}{A vector of seasons in which recruitment occurs (1 - 4)}

\item{recruitment_age}{The age of recruitment to the fishery}

\item{niters}{The number of iterations.}

\item{sd}{The standard deviation when applying random lognormal noise to some of the slots.}
}
\value{
