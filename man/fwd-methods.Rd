\arguments{
\item{object}{An FLStock, an FLBiol or an FLBiols object.}

\item{fishery}{If object is an FLBiol(s), a FLFishery(ies). Else this argument is ignored.}

\item{control}{A fwdControl object.}

\item{effort_max}{Maximum yearly rate of change in effort for each fishery}

\item{deviances}{An FLQuant of deviances for the stock recruitment relationship (if object is an FLStock).}

\item{residuals}{Old argument name for deviances, to be deleted}

\item{...}{Stormbending.}

\item{sr}{a predictModel, FLSr or list that describes the stock recruitment relationship (if object is an FLStock).}
}
\value{
Either an FLStock, or a list of FLFishery and FLBiol objects.
}
\description{
fwd() projects the fishery through time and attempts to hit the specified
targets by finding the appropriate fishing effort.
}
\details{
A projection is run on either an FLStock object (for a single species, single
fishery projection), or a pair of FLBiol(s) and FLFishery(ies) objects
(for more advanced mixed fisheries projections).

The projection is controlled by the fwdControl object (although it is also
possible to control the projection of an FLStock using a different interface).
In each timestep of the projection, the fishing effort of each FLFishery (or F 
multiplier if object is an FLStock) is found so that the targets specified in
the fwdControl object are hit.

For more details and examples, see the vignettes in the package and also the
tutorial at: http://www.flr-project.org/doc/Forecasting_on_the_Medium_Term_for_advice_using_FLasher.html
